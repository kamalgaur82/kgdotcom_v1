Swiggy should look to build a ‘taste fingerprint’ for every user based on their order history. This ‘tongue print’ will represent the unique food preferences of the user, which will differ for everyone, based on the distinctions in our choices.

Based off this ‘tongue print’, Swiggy should then look at identifying dishes that are best suited to that user. If done right, this hyper-personalized targeting of food options can easily lead to an uptick in the revenue per user that Swiggy is able to generate – either through just generating more orders, or even through some sort of subscription fees that users willingly pay for in exchange for quicker discovery of food that they enjoy.
