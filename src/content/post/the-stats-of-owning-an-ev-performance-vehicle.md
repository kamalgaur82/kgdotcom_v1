I find myself in between cars, having sold my Honda City in Feb 2023 after owning it for 13 years. I had just crossed 80K kms, which if I ignore the 2 years the car sat unattended in Bangalore, comes to approx 606 km per month (513 km per month if I include all 13 years).

My heart has been set on EVs since many years, and I just wasn’t (and still am not) able to bring myself to buy an ICE vehicle. And being the hard-core value seeker I am, spending what is considerably more on an EV car (than a comparable ICE car) didn’t make sense unless the car sparked joy. And so far, none of the EV car options have done that when it comes to price and performance both.

So here we are… 9 months down the line, with a motorcycle being my primary (read only) means of transport. I rented a bunch of different motorcycles from Feb all the way to Jun – the Bajaj Pulsar 250N (BS6), the Royal Enfield Himalayan, the Suzuki Gixxer 150 2022, the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650, the Royal Enfield Thunderbird x 350 ABS, the Hero Xpulse 200 4v 2023 and the Yamaha R15 V3\. I enjoyed many of them, especially the riding stance and the power of the Himalayan. But as time went by, I realized I had to make a decision. As easy as it was to rent bikes for weeks on end, I knew I had to take a decision to buy a vehicle of my own…

This segues nicely to present day, which marks just under 5 months of owning the next best thing to an EV car…

An EV motorcycle…

Mine looks something like this…

And in 2023, with technology integrations being the way they are, it allows me to track lifetime stats for my bike, which look something like this…

Do have a look and let me know in the comments which metric surprised you the most… and if you think there are any metrics I am missing out on capturing.
