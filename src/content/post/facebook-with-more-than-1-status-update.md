I know it might seem like an overkill but I do believe that Facebook should roll out an option for users to post 2 status updates instead of 1.

The reason I say that is because there are times, when one has more than 1 thing that they’d want to express to the world… and not have one overwrite the other.

Now some of you might wonder why 2, why not more? Well, 2 is a start… and a change that most Facebook users should be able to adopt to. In the long run, depending on how many people use 2, Facebook might decide to find out how many status updates do people really want?

As for Facebook’s mission of making the world more connected, what better way than to allow people to express more and more?
