Currently Cred allows for users to add their cards in the app so as to track spends and make payments on time. However, as you load any card, the Cred app automatically decides what color to assign to the corresponding visual card image that it shows within the app.

The idea is to let users select the color that they want to assign to each card, which in my case, I will do to match the actual color of the card.

For users, it will become a lot more intuitive to reference which card to use in the real world (by looking at outstanding dues) by sight and color, and not only by trying to match the last 4 digits of the card (which for me, is sometimes is only a digit apart in the case of Amex or ICICI).

Cred could even go one step further and even allow users to take a picture of their card, and use that picture instead (after redacting/anonymizing sensitive details like card numbers / card expiry / etc).
