People wonder about who is the fastest bowler in world cricket today?

However, there are two parts to bowling speed.

The first part is the speed at which the bowler runs, and  
the second part is the speed at which his arm bowls the ball.

Obviously, the bowler’s bowling speed is the sum of both the speeds.

I’m just waiting for the sports channels to catch up on this point and start breaking down bowling speeds into running speed and arm bowling speed.

Maybe we’ll find that the world’s fastest bowler is fastest because of his running speed more than anything else.

Will make for quite interesting commentary, don’t you think?
