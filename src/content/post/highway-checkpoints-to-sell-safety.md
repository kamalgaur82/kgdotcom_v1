The idea is simple – there are 2 checkpoints on the highway. The first checkpoint **_jots down all vehicle numbers_** as they pass. As they pass, the **_attendant flashes a light on the rear of the vehicle_** to see if it has a sufficient quantity of working safety gear (like reflectors or intact tail lights). If not, he passes that information on to the next checkpoint, where the **_second attendant flags down only those vehicles that have been identified at the first checkpoint for missing safety gear_**. Apart from fining these vehicles, the second checkpoint also has safety equipment like reflectors that can be sold to these errant vehicle drivers, and can even be installed on the spot.
