2021 has seen a stark increase in transaction fees on popular crypto networks, none so more than Ethereum, where user-facing fees have regularly crossed $100 for long periods of time.

The idea is that every platform, centralized or decentralized, worth its salt should provide the “ability to let users schedule a transaction when the associated fees on the network have crossed a certain threshold”

This can be done in a multitude of ways –

* allowing users to schedule a transaction when the transaction fee hits/crosses a certain threshold, so that the transaction goes through automatically
* building a widget that allows notifies users that the transaction fee on the network has crossed a certain threshold (above or below) so that users can log in to manually trigger the transaction
