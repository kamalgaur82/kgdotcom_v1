Audible is owned by Amazon. As a result, it should be relatively trivial to allow for integration between Audible and Amazon. It’s surprising to see an empty Audible library & wishlist, and no way to fill it except by adding books manually one by one. I already have hundreds of books on my Amazon wishlist, and if I’m going to use Audible, I’d like to see which of those books from my Amazon wishlist are available on Audible, so that I can decide which one to start with. I don’t need to go about content discovery from scratch on Audible coz I’ve already done that and saved my books on Amazon’s wishlist.

And ideally, Audible should allow you to import anyone’s Amazon book wishlist, even if it’s not your own – as long as you can access the wishlist’s public URL, it should be importable.
