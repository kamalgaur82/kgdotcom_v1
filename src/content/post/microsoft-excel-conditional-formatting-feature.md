Since decades now, Microsoft Excel’s conditional formatting feature is applied on cells based on what those cells contain. However, one often comes across situations where this feature limits you from what you’d like your Excel to do for you.

The idea is for MS Excel to enable conditional formatting to work on cells not only based off what those cells contain, but also off what other cells contain.

Needless to say, the way to reference other cells could be using fixed (static) reference cells/ranges or relative/dynamic cells/ranges (based on x rows and y columns distance from cells being formatted).
