Gmail has, over the years, intelligently avoided the problem of folders by using labels.

However, there are usability issues that they haven’t addressed yet, and hence remain unsolved –

1 – No way to sort mails since inbox is sorted by date of receipt (latest to oldest) by default

This means if I want to see all mails grouped by a Sender or Sender Email ID, I have to use Search to filter them out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2 – No summary of who is sending how many mails to you

Let’s face it – the 7.5 GB inbox has stopped us from thinking twice before cluttering it.

What we need now is a basic summary table – grouped by Sender, with a count of emails received from each Sender. This summary table should be cross-tabbed across Date/Week/Month/Year to allow for sharper understanding.

3 – Filters only allow inputs towards

* From
* To
* Subject
* Has these words
* Doesn’t have these words

Ideally, all permutations across the **_parts of an email_** and the **_Has/Doesn’t have_** strings should be covered, like this –

* From – Has these words
* From – Doesn’t have these words

* To – Has these words
* To – Doesn’t have these words

* Subject – Has these words
* Subject – Doesn’t have these words

* Body – Has these words
* Body – Doesn’t have these words

If possible, it should also have additional features like –

* cc – Has these words
* cc – Doesn’t have these words

* Attachments – Has these words in **filename**
* Attachments – Doesn’t have these words in **filename**

* Attachments – Has these words in **file content**
* Attachments – Doesn’t have these words in **file content**

4 – Only one string input per box can be used while setting up a filter

This means that filters with multiple string inputs for a particular box will have to be set up separately.

At the first glance, that seems like a waste of time – however it might just be a more efficient easier-to-handle way of managing filters, which we will delve into later.
