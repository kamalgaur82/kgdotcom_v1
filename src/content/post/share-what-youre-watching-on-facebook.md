If you’re watching something, and you want to share that as a post, there should be an easy way of doing that on the Facebook Feed. Currently the best way I know is this – find the page for that movie, like it, and write a status update that tags that page – which is too cumbersome and painful.

Ideally, there should be an application that integrates within Facebook, by which I mean, it shouldn’t look like an application, for example, a lot of the Birthday Wish applications that exist.

One should be able to access the entire global repository of movies and TV shows using this application – not only the U.S. ones. IMdB is far better that way. Once you have accessed the index of the repository, one should just be able to select what it is they are watching and maybe even tag people whom you are watching with, or users whom you want to tell what you are watching. And of course, you could allow the user to rate what he is watching by giving a rating out of 5 stars.

Once these selections are made using no more than a few clicks, there should be a single-click way of publishing the update.

The update would look something like this –  
(needless to say all **_text in bold italics_** should be clickable links)
