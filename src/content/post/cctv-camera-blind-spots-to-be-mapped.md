All CCTV cameras come with a certain field of view and coverage, and there is no easy way to measure or map their blind spots.

The idea here is that the CCTV camera X in question will project an infrared (IR) blast which will spread across the area that’s in the camera X’s field of view. Since this is invisible to the naked eye, we will use other IR-sensitive CCTV cameras (A, B, C) to detect where these infrared rays have reached. Based on that, these other cameras will be able to show which through their live view, areas where camera X has coverage and areas where camera X has blind spots.
