I have long believed that emails are amongst the easiest ways to create a lot of storage requirements at the click of a button. Most of us use Microsoft Outlook at work where we are limited to certain mailbox sizes as set by administrators.

Outlook should have the ability to track how many attachments are getting duplicated across emails (1 copy for each recipient) and instead of taking up space in every user’s inbox, find a way to retain only 1 copy of the attachment file. This would mean that Outlook links all related emails to that 1 copy.

Not only will this save tons of storage space for users and the organization, but this will also save hours of effort for users who end up hitting their mailbox limits, after which they need to spend time looking for emails with large attachments so that they can remove those emails (or attachments) to save space.
