I have been using Pocket to bookmark URLs for a while now. And one of the annoying things I find is the fact that Pocket adds the following string at the end of all URLs I save with them – “?utm\_source=pocket\_shared”.  
  
At the very least, Pocket should provide users with the ability to strip away all the query parameters to the right of “?”.

I have also noticed that Pocket ends up saving duplicate URLs separately as well – and again, it should offer the functionality to remove duplicates.

Last but not the least, Pocket should also offer users the ability to easily import from (or export to) other platforms like Diigo or Facebook, or even to a text or csv file.
